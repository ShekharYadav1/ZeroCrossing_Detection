This post shows how to implement an isolated zero crossing detection circuit using an analog comparator and optocoupler, circuit schematic is the one below.

Circuit Description:

A zero crossing detector is an electronic circuit used to detect the exact moment when the voltage of an alternating current (AC) signal passes through zero volts. In other words, the zero-crossing detection circuit detects when an AC signal voltage changes from positive to negative and vice versa.

Basically, the zero-crossing detector circuit has an analog input for the AC signal and a logic output that changes with respect to the input AC signal. For example if the input signal is in its positive cycle then the circuit outputs a logic high (or logic low depending on the design of the circuit), and if the input signal is in its negative cycle then the circuit outputs a logic low (or logic high).
